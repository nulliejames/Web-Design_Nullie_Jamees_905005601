            The Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) was established in
            1960, the same year Sierra Leone gained independence. For over six
            decades, we have been at the forefront of football development in
            our nation, navigating challenges and celebrating triumphs. From our
            early days organizing local competitions to our current role as a
            member of FIFA, CAF, and WAFU, SLFA has consistently worked to
            elevate Sierra Leonean football on both the national and
            international stages.
